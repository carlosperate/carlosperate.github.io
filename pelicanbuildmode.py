"""
Rather than use something like environmental variables to change between
DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION, pelican prefers to use different config files for
the different builds.

In this case, because there is a lot of overlap we configure everything inside
pelicanconf.py and use this module to indicate which build mode to use.

This can be imported and configured inside pelicanpublish.py before importing
pelicanconf.py.
