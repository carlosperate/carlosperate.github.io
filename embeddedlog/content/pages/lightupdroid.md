This is an Android companion app for the [LightUpPi Alarm](https://github.com/carlosperate/LightUpPi-Alarm).

It is an Android alarm app that synchronizes to the alarms running in the `LightUpPi Alarm` Raspberry Pi system.

It is based on the [Alarm Clock](https://github.com/klinker41/alarm-clock) app by Jacob Klinker, which in turn is a modification of the official Android Open Source Project [DeskClock](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/DeskClock/) (updated for backwards compatibility).
