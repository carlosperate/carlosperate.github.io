Ardublockly is a visual programming editor for Arduino. It is based on Google's [Blockly][1], which has been forked to generate [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) code.

The "ArdublocklyServer" Python package initialises a local server to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE][2].

This is all packaged in a self contained executable:

## Features
* Generate Arduino code with visual drag-and-drop blocks
* Load the code to an Arduino Board
* Useful "code block warnings"
* Compatible with a wide range of official Arduino Boards
* Runs on Windows / Linux / Mac OS X

Ardublockly is still under development and a few features are not yet implemented. A to-do list can be found in the [TODO.md][3] file.

Currently tested under Windows with Python 2.7 and 3.4 and in Linux and MacOS X with Python 2.7.


## Online Demos
A demo of the current state of Ardublockly can be found in the following two links (to load the code into an Arduino requires Ardublockly to be executed locally):

#### [Ardublockly][10] (with responsive design)

#### [Ardublockly classic][11]

## Installing
There is a packaged version for Windows that runs as a stand-alone executable and can be downloaded from the [Ardublockly repository releases page][4].

Installation instructions for developers can be found in [this Github repository Wiki][5]. This will work on Windows, Linux and MacOS X.

It also needs the [Arduino IDE version 1.6 or higher](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software).


## Running
1. [Install Ardublockly][5].
2. Install the [Arduino IDE][2] version 1.6 or higher.
3. Run Ardublockly as defined in your installation method.
3. Configure Ardublockly to locate the Arduino IDE [following these instructions][6].
