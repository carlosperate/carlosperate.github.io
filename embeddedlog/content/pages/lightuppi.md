This is a Clock Alarm System, with lights and mains socket switch control for the Raspberry Pi.

It has been modularised into the following packages:

* __LightUpAlarm__: Completely independent Python package to manage alarms (create, edit, delete, and run alarms).
* __LightUpHardware__: Controls external hardware to complement the alarm ring, in this case controls the room lights, mains socket switch, and snooze functionality from a physical button.
* __LightUpServer__: Creates an HTTP server to interface with the LightUpAlarm system using a web interface or JSON (used in the LightUpDroid Android app).
* __LightUpWeb__: Front-end web interface for the LightUpServer. 

Additionally, an Android application can be used to interface with the LightUpPi Alarm system. For more information about this app please visit its repository: [LightUpDrop Alarm](https://github.com/carlosperate/LightUpDroid-Alarm)
