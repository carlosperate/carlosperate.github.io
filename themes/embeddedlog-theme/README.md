# Embedded Log Pelican theme

This is a fork of pelican-bootstrap3 theme adapted for the
[www.embeddedlog.com](http://www.embeddedlog.com) website.

Please note that this fork has had major changes that are directly related to
the contents and specific requirements of the
[embeddedlog](http://www.embeddedlog.com) website, so it cannot be dropped
into a generic pelican project without some modifications.

Other changes:
- Font Awesome been updated from version v4.x to v5.9.
- Shariff has been updated from version v1.7.3 to v3.2.1.
    - SHARIFF_BUTTON_STYLE option created with the update
    - CSS overwritten for round corners

The original pelican-bootstrap3 theme has been moved from its own repository
https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3 to be part of pelican-themes:
https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/commits/master/pelican-bootstrap3

Last sync was at commit 2019/01/20: be0a4105c4e748b9abe91893544a5362d8a23772

## pelican-bootstrap3

This is a Bootstrap 3 theme for Pelican. It's fully responsive. Bootstrap 3 has seen an official, final release now, so
I don't expect any breaking changes anymore. I will try to keep it up-to-date.

### CONTRIBUTING

If you want to adjust this theme to your own liking, I encourage you to fork it. This theme has started to gather more
and more attention in the form of stars and forks. If you make improvements that are useful to others and can make the
theme better in general **please don't hesitate to make a pull request**. For contributing guidelines, [look here](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Installation

First:

`git clone https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3.git`

Then:

Point the `THEME` variable in your `pelicanconf.py` to `/path/to/pelican-bootstrap3`

### Usage

This theme honors the following standard Pelican settings:

* Putting feeds in the `<head>` section:
	* `FEED_ALL_ATOM`
	* `FEED_ALL_RSS`
* Template settings:
	* `DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU`
	* `DISPLAY_CATEGORIES_ON_MENU`
	* `MENUITEMS`
	* `LINKS` (Blogroll will be put in the sidebar instead of the head)
* Analytics & Comments
	* `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` (classic tracking code)
	* `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_UNIVERSAL` and `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_UNIVERSAL_PROPERTY` (Universal tracking code)
	* `DISQUS_SITENAME`

It uses the `tag_cloud` variable for displaying tags in the sidebar. You can control the amount of tags shown with: `TAG_CLOUD_MAX_ITEMS`

### Extras

#### Bootswatch and other Bootstrap 3 themes

Part of the versatility of this theme comes from the fact that I included all the lovely Bootstrap 3 themes from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), built by [Thomas Park](https://github.com/thomaspark). You can tell Pelican what Bootswatch theme to use, by setting `BOOTSTRAP_THEME` to the desired theme, in lowercase (ie. 'readable' or 'cosmo' etc.). My own site is using _Simplex_. If you want to use any other Bootstrap 3 compatible theme, just put the minified CSS in the `static/css` directory and rename it using the following naming scheme: `bootstrap.{theme-name}.min.css`. Then update the `BOOTSTRAP_THEME` variable with the _theme-name_ used.

#### Article info

Set `SHOW_ARTICLE_AUTHOR` to True to show the author of the article at the top of the article and in the index of articles. Set `SHOW_ARTICLE_CATEGORY` to show the Category of each article. Set `SHOW_DATE_MODIFIED` to True to show the article modified date next to the published date.

#### Pygments

You can choose the syntax highlighting style by using the `PYGMENTS_STYLE` variable to specify one of the built-in Pygments styles. By default the `native` style is used. The following styles are avaiable:

- autumn
- borland
- bw
- colorful
- default
- emacs
- friendly
- fruity
- manni
- monokai
- murphy
- native
- pastie
- perldoc
- solarizeddark
- solarizedlight
- tango
- trac
- vim
- vs
- zenburn

For a demo of the different Pygment styles, have a look [here](http://pygments.org/demo/218030/)

#### Pagination

Pelican-Bootstrap3 follows the standard Pagination settings of Pelican and uses the Bootstrap3 [Pagination component](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#pagination), but you can optionally use the Boostrap3 _Pager_ by setting `USE_PAGER` to `True`.

#### Bootstrap fluid layout

If you'd like to use the fluid container layout from Bootstrap, set the flag `BOOTSTRAP_FLUID` to _True_.

#### Site Brand

You can provide a logo for your site using `SITELOGO`. For example: `SITELOGO = 'images/my_site_logo.png'`. You can then define the size of the logo using `SITELOGO_SIZE`. The `width` of the `<img>` element will be set accordingly.

By default the `SITENAME` will be shown as well. It's also possible to hide the site name using the `HIDE_SITENAME` flag.

#### Breadcrumbs

It's possible to show breadcrumbs in your site using the `DISPLAY_BREADCRUMBS` flag. By default the article category isn't shown in the breadcrumbs, if you wish to enable it, set the `DISPLAY_CATEGORY_IN_BREADCRUMBS` flag to _True_.

### Navbar

If you wish to use the inverse navbar from Bootstrap, set the flag `BOOTSTRAP_NAVBAR_INVERSE` to _True_.

#### Related Posts

This theme has support for the [Related Posts plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/related_posts). All you have to do, is enable the plugin, and the theme will do the rest.

### Series

This theme supports the [Series plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/series). If you enable the plugin you will find in the footer the links to the previous and next articles in the series.

You may customize the header of this list setting the `SERIES_TEXT` variable, which can also include the `index` and `name` variables. The first is the index of the current article in the series (starting from 1) and the second is the name of the series. The default string is `Part %(index)s of the %(name)s series`.

You may display on the sidebar the link to the previous and next article in the series setting `DISPLAY_SERIES_ON_SIDEBAR` to `True`.

You may display information on the series just under the article title setting `SHOW_SERIES` to `True`.

#### Favicon

Set the `FAVICON` option in your `pelicanconf.py`. For example: `FAVICON = 'images/favicon.png'`

#### Index page

* If `DISPLAY_ARTICLE_INFO_ON_INDEX` is set to _True_, article info (date, tags) will be show under the title for each article, otherwise only title and summary will be shown (default).

#### Short menu labels for pages

By default, the title of a page is used both for showing the title as
part of a page's content, and, if pages in menu is enabled, as the
label of the corresponding menu item. You can choose a different label
for the menu (such as a short single word) than the page title by adding a
Menulabel metadata attribute to the page header (`Menulabel:` in
markdown, `:Menulabel:` in rst).

#### About Me

You can show a short blurb of text about yourself and a picture. The following two settings are used for this:

* Your 'About Me' paragraph will be whatever the `ABOUT_ME` variable is set to (raw html is allowed)
* Your avatar can be set by pointing the `AVATAR` variable to the relevant picture (e.g. 'images/profile.png')

#### Sidebar options

The following things can be displayed on the sidebar:

* **Social links** can be provided through the `SOCIAL` variable. If it's empty, the section will not be shown
	* In your `pelicanconf.py` provide your social links like this:

```
SOCIAL = (('twitter', 'http://twitter.com/DaanDebie'),
          ('linkedin', 'http://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldebie'),
          ('github', 'http://github.com/DandyDev'),)
```
* **Tags** will be shown if `DISPLAY_TAGS_ON_SIDEBAR` is set to _True_. Normally, tags are shown as a list.
	* Set `DISPLAY_TAGS_INLINE` to _True_, to display the tags inline (ie. as tagcloud)
* **Categories** will be shown if `DISPLAY_CATEGORIES_ON_SIDEBAR` is set to _True_
* **Recent Posts** will be shown if `DISPLAY_RECENT_POSTS_ON_SIDEBAR` is set to _True_
	* Use `RECENT_POST_COUNT` to control the amount of recent posts. Defaults to **5**

To remove the sidebar entirely, set `HIDE_SIDEBAR` to _True_.

#### Disqus comments

* This theme sets identifiers for each article's comment threads. If you are switching from a theme that doesn't (such as the Pelican built-in default) this will result in existing comments getting lost. To prevent this, set DISQUS_NO_ID to _True_.
* Set DISQUS_ID_PREFIX_SLUG to _True_ if you have configured your article URLs such that the slug alone will likely not be unique. Ignored if DISQUS_NO_ID is _True_.
* You can also enable Disqus comments for pages. This is a per-page setting you can control by adding a field `comments` to you pages' metadata. Set it to _enabled_ to enable comments for that page. Comment-threads for pages will have an id that is prefixed by 'page-'.
* To show Disqus comment counts on the index page, set DISQUS_DISPLAY_COUNTS to _True_.

#### Content license

You can optionally declare a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org) for the content of your site. It will appear in the site's footer. To enable, use one of the following two ways for configuration.

* To choose the license by name, set `CC_LICENSE` to the common abbreviated name of the license: `"CC-BY"` (require attribution), `"CC-BY-SA"` (require ShareAlike), `"CC-BY-ND"` (NoDerivatives) , `"CC-BY-NC"` (require attribution, no commercial reuse), `"CC-BY-NC-SA"` (require ShareAlike, no commercial reuse), or `"CC-BY-NC-ND"` (NoDerivatives, no commercial reuse).
* Alternatively, choose the licence by features:
    * `CC_LICENSE_DERIVATIVES` - `"yes"` if permitted, `"no"` if not permitted, and `"ShareAlike"` if derivatives must be shared under the same terms.
    * `CC_LICENSE_COMMERCIAL` - `"yes"` if commercial reuse is permitted, and `"no"` otherwise.
* Optionally, you can include attribution markup in the license mark by setting `CC_ATTR_MARKUP` to _True_.

The license choice mirrors the [Creative Commons License Chooser](http://creativecommons.org/choose/). Source for the macro that renders the mark is at http://github.com/hlapp/cc-tools.

#### GitHub

The theme can show your most recently active GitHub repos in the sidebar. To enable, provide a `GITHUB_USER`. Appearance and behaviour can be controlled using the following variables:

* `GITHUB_REPO_COUNT`: An integer representing the number of repos to display (sorted by modification date, descending)
* `GITHUB_SKIP_FORK`: Either `'false'` [default] or `'true'`. If `'true'`, exclude forked repositories from display in the sidebar.
* `GITHUB_SHOW_USER_LINK`: If undefined [default], don't show a link to the `GITHUB_USER`'s user page. If defined, show it.

NOTE: Boolean values will _not_ work here! They will be interpreted as literal strings by JS, so instead use `'true'` and `'false'`

#### Facebook Open Graph

In order to make the Facebook like button and other social sharing options work better, the template contains Open Graph metatags like `<meta property="og:type" content="article"/>`. You can disable them by setting `USE_OPEN_GRAPH` to _False_. You can use `OPEN_GRAPH_FB_APP_ID` to provide a Facebook _app id_.
You can also provide a default image that will be passed as an Open Graph tag  by setting `OPEN_GRAPH_IMAGE` to a relative file path, which will be prefixed by your site's base url. Optionally, you can override this default image on a per article and per page basis, by setting the `og_image` variable in an article or page.

#### Twitter Cards

The theme supports [Summary Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card). To activate the necessary tags set `TWITTER_CARDS` to `True`. Because _Twitter Cards_ also use Open Graph tags to identify some of the necessary metadata, `USE_OPEN_GRAPH` must also be set to `True` (which is the default).

You can optionally provide a `TWITTER_USERNAME` which will be used to set the Twitter username for the site and for the content creator.

The same image options for Open Graph (see above) can be used for setting images that appear on Twitter Cards. So if you have set an `OPEN_GRAPH_IMAGE` and optionally `og_image` for articles and/or pages, you're good to go for Twitter Cards as well.

#### Twitter Timeline

The theme can show your twitter timeline in the sidebar. To enable, provide a `TWITTER_USERNAME` and a `DISPLAY_TWITTER_TIMELINE_ON_SIDEBAR`.

To get a `TWITTER_WIDGET_ID`, go to: https://twitter.com/settings/widgets and select `Create new`. You'll find the TWITTER_WIDGET_ID under the html or in the site url:

`https://twitter.com/settings/widgets/TWITTER_WIDGET_ID/edit`

#### Shariff

As an alternative, you may use [Shariff](https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff) by setting `SHARIFF = True`. This will display the privacy enabled social media buttons developed by [heiseonline](https://github.com/heiseonline).

  * By default, `data-url` is set to the URL of the current article.
  * To customize the social media buttons, set
    * `SHARIFF_BACKEND_URL` (see [Shariff Backends](https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff#backends))
    * `SHARIFF_LANG` (`de` (default), `en` or `fr`)
    * `SHARIFF_ORIENTATION` (`horizontal` (default) or `vertical`)
    * `SHARIFF_SERVICES` (default: `[&quot;facebook&quot;,&quot;googleplus&quot;]`)
    * `SHARIFF_THEME` (`standard` or `gray`)
    * `SHARIFF_TWITTER_VIA` (`True`/`False`, uses `TWITTER_USERNAME`)

For a detailed description of each setting, refer to [data attributes](https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff#options-data-attributes) description at the [Shariff README](https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff).

#### Footer

The footer will display a copyright message using the AUTHOR variable and the year of the latest post. If a content license mark is enabled (see above), that will be shown as well.
